The AGC meeting confirmed that the team can extend their existing CPAD environment (EAI: 12087) for Communications Surveillance rather than creating a separate environment, using the same resource group with internal segregation through Databricks ACLs, new SQL databases, and storage containers to separate market surveillance and communications data access. However, they discovered potential compliance issues - the current environment may not be in the proper landing zone and the previously approved Azure Speech Services component is now broken due to Microsoft's AI rebranding. Next steps include Stephen creating an updated architecture diagram with Surveil-X data flow, checking GRC compliance status for potential landing zone migration, decommissioning the old Speech Services component, and proceeding with technical implementation using Databricks' granular permission controls to achieve the required data segregation between teams without needing a new AGC submission.
