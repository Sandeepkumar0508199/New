1. Introduction
This document provides a step-by-step record of the integration between Trade Data Repository (TDR) and Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) for orchestrating analytics pipelines via Azure Data Factory (ADF).
The objective of this integration is to ensure that downstream analytics pipelines are only triggered after confirming the successful completion of upstream dependencies — specifically:
•	EBS loads (T-1)
•	PL_Notify_CCAMS process (T-2)



2. SPN Authentication and Azure Integration
To establish secure communication between TWS, TDR, and Azure Data Factory, we leveraged an existing Service Principal Name (SPN) already configured with contributor access to the relevant Azure resources.
SPN Authentication Setup
•	The existing centralized SPN is used to authenticate TWS and ADF activities securely.
•	This SPN is managed under Azure Active Directory (AAD) and has:
o	Contributor rights to the required resource groups (TDR and CCAMS).
o	Permissions to trigger ADF pipelines.
o	Access scope limited to QA, REL, and PROD environments for security compliance.
Integration Touchpoints
•	TWS authenticates with Azure using the SPN and triggers ADF pipelines securely.
•	The SPN's credentials are stored securely in TWS as part of the job stream configuration and are rotated per organizational policy.

2. Triggering Logic After Integration (REL Environment)
The following section outlines the exact sequence of pipeline executions within the REL environment:
Step 1: NY-TDR-LOAD-EBS (T 1 Load)
•	ADF Name: adf-tdr-rel-use2
•	Pipeline Name: NY-TDR-LOAD-EBS
•	Trigger Source: TWS
•	Purpose: Loads trade data files into TDR
•	Schedule: Daily
Step 2: PL_Notify_CCAMS (T 2 Readiness Check)
•	ADF Name: adf-tdr-rel-use2
•	Pipeline Name: PL_Notify_CCAMS
•	Dependency: Waits for NY-TDR-LOAD-EBS to succeed
•	Purpose: Validates T 1 data and signals readiness for analytics
Step 3: Master 2A 2B Patterns
•	ADF Name: adf-ccams-rel-use2-01
•	Pipeline Name: Master 2A 2B Patterns
•	Dependency: Triggered by PL_Notify_CCAMS completion
•	Purpose: Kicks off various 2A/2B surveillance pattern jobs
Step 4: PL_CCAMSRequest
•	ADF Name: adf-tdr-rel-use2
•	Pipeline Name: PL_CCAMSRequest
•	Dependency: Executes after Master 2A 2B Patterns pipeline completes
•	Purpose: Submits analytics outputs or initiates final downstream processing
Summary Table:
Step	Pipeline	ADF Name	Dependency
1	NY-TDR-LOAD-EBS	adf-tdr-rel-use2	Triggered by TWS
2	PL_Notify_CCAMS	adf-tdr-rel-use2	After NY-TDR-LOAD-EBS
3	Master 2A 2B Patterns	adf-ccams-rel-use2-01	After PL_Notify_CCAMS
4	PL_CCAMSRequest	adf-tdr-rel-use2	After Master 2A 2B
